        value we sure do.\\r\\n\u2014 Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) January 23, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd
        here's the letter:\\r\\nDear Fellow Apple Shareholders,\\r\\nOver the course
        of my long career as an investor and as Chairman of Icahn Enterprises, our
        best performing investments result from opportunities that we like to call
        \\\"no brainers.\\\" Recent examples of such \u201Cno brainers\u201D have
        been our investments in Netflix, Hain Celestial, Chesapeake, Forest Labs and
        Herbalife, just to name a few. In our opinion, a great example of a \u201Cno
        brainer\u201D in today\u2019s market is Apple. The S 500\u2019s price to earnings
        multiple is 71% higher than Apple\u2019s, and if Apple were simply valued
        at the same multiple, its share price would be $840, which is 52% higher than
        its current price.1 This is a dramatic valuation disconnect that simply makes
        no sense to us, and it seems that the company agrees with us on this point.
        Tim Cook himself has expressed on more than one occasion that Apple is undervalued,
        and as the company states, it already has in place \u201Cthe largest share
        repurchase authorization in history.\u201D We believe, however, that this
        share repurchase authorization can and should be even larger, and effectuating
        that for the benefit of all of the company\u2019s shareholders is the sole
        intention of our proposal. The company has recommended voting against our
        proposal for various reasons. It seems to us that the basis of its argument
        against our proposal is that the company believes, because of the \u201Cdynamic
        competitive landscape\u201D and because its \u201Crapid pace of innovation
        require[s] unprecedented investment, flexibility and access to resources\u201D,
        it does not currently have enough excess liquidity to increase the size of
        its repurchase program. Assuming this indeed is the basis for the company\u2019s
        argument, we find its position overly conservative (almost to the point of
        being irrational), when we consider that the company had $130 billion of net
        cash as of September 28, 2013 and that consensus earnings are expected to
        be almost $40 billion next year. Given this massive net cash position and
        robust earnings generation, Apple is perhaps the most overcapitalized company
        in corporate history, from our perspective. Regardless of what liquidity it
        may require with respect to \u201Cunprecedented investment, flexibility and
        access to resources\u201D for innovation moving forward, we believe the unprecedented
        degree to which the company is currently overcapitalized would overcompensate
        for any such investments (including possible investments in strategic M, to
        which the company does not refer). Said another way, we believe that the combination
        of the company\u2019s unprecedentedly enormous net cash balance, robust annual
        earnings, and tremendous borrowing capacity provide more than enough excess
        liquidity to afford both the use of cash for any necessary ongoing business-related
        investments in addition to the cash used for the increased share repurchases
        proposed.\\r\\nIt is our belief that it is the responsibility of the Board,
        on behalf of the company\u2019s shareholders, to take advantage of such a
        large and unmistakable opportunity. Indeed, we believe that by choosing not
        to increase the size of the repurchase program, the directors are actually
        performing a great disservice to the owners, especially smaller shareholders
        who may not be in a position to buy more stock themselves. Meanwhile, we are
        in a position to continue buying shares in the market at today's price, so
        perhaps we should thank the Board for not being more aggressive, and thus
        allowing us to accumulate an even larger investment position at a price that
        reflects the aforementioned valuation disconnect. In fact, over the past two
        weeks we purchased $1 billion more in Apple shares, $500 million of which
        we purchased today, bringing our total ownership position in Apple to a current
        value of approximately $3.6 billion.\\r\\nGiven the degree to which Apple
        appears undervalued to us, we almost feel that it\u2019s a waste of time to
        debate the point. As we believe it to be the preeminent and most innovative
        consumer products company in the world, with the greatest brand, hardware,
        software, and services in the world, Apple has had tremendous growth to date,
        and we fail to see why this growth would not continue moving forward. The
        industry (smartphones and tablets) is expected to grow volume at a 15% compounded
        annual growth rate from 2013 through 2017 according to IDC. We believe Apple
        should continue to benefit from this secular growth, as last year, 85% of
        Apple\u2019s revenues came from smartphones, tablets, and related software,
        services, and accessories. The naysayers question whether Apple will be able
        to participate in this growth without sacrificing pricing and gross margins,
        especially with competition from Google, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon and Chinese
        manufacturers. Our response to them is that the answer is already evident
        to us from the continuing loyalty of Apple\u2019s growing customer base. The
        highly successful evolutionary (not revolutionary) introductions of the iPhone
        5s and 5c and Ipad Air and Mini, prove to us that Apple could, for the most
        part, maintain pricing and gross margin as we believe consumers are willing
        to pay a reasonable premium for the world\u2019s best smartphones and tablets.
        The rumored future introduction of product line extensions with larger screens
        for both the iPhone and iPad would further support this view.2 In fact, a
        recent study from NDC shows that the iPhone accounted for 42% of smartphone
        users in the United States at the end of 2013, up a staggering 20% from the
        prior year. Despite its great scale and narrow focus, Apple has an operating
        margin of just 28.5%. We believe its customers\u2019 willingness to pay a
        premium price for the world\u2019s greatest products should enable Apple to
        participate in the expected volume growth of these categories while at the
        same time largely maintaining its average selling prices and gross margins.
        And, as software and services improve and become even more important to consumers
        in the future, we expect customer loyalty to strengthen further.\\r\\nEven
        if the story ended with Apple\u2019s existing product and software lines,
        we would still choose to make Apple our largest investment. But there is more
        to the story! Tim Cook keeps saying that he expects to introduce \u201Cnew
        products in new categories\u201D and yet very few people seem to be listening.
        We\u2019re not aware of a single Wall Street analyst who includes \u201Cnew
        products in new categories\u201D or new services in any of their financial
        projections, even though Apple clearly has an impressive track record of such
        new category product introductions, even if it does so rarely. Apple released
        the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad five years later in 2012, both so extraordinarily
        successful that today they represent the majority of the company\u2019s revenue.
        Tim Cook\u2019s comments, along with advancements in enabling technologies,
        lead us to believe that we may see in the not too distant future what new
        groundbreaking products they\u2019ve been working on developing in Cupertino
        these last several years.3\\r\\nTo get a sense of the scale of the opportunity
        that stems from new products in new categories, let\u2019s take a moment to
        consider the possibility of an Apple television. The major electronics companies
        are now focused on ultra high definition TVs as their next big opportunity.
        Ultra high definition is expected to offer a level of image clarity that is
        superior to today\u2019s high definition televisions for screen sizes 55 inches
        and above. To date, the barrier to mass market adoption of ultra high definition
        has been the price gap between it and regular high definition, but that price
        gap is closing and will soon be de minimis. The closing of this price gap
        is supported by statements made by the Co-CEO of Samsung Electronics, who
        expects the price gap to fall to 10% by the end of this year. While cable
        companies will likely be slow to upgrade their linear TV infrastructure due
        to cost, video content is expected to be accessible through the internet via
        services like Netflix and others. We believe ultra high definition represents
        a major catalyst for the next TV replacement cycle and a promising moment
        for Apple to introduce its first new product in this category. Reed Hastings,
        CEO of Netflix, has referenced ultra high definition as a major catalyst for
        Netflix going forward. While this is true for Netflix, we believe it is also
        true for Apple, not just for its hardware but also for selling ultra high
        definition movies and shows on iTunes through the internet. With 238 million
        TVs sold globally in 2012, it would not surprise us if Apple could sell 25
        million new Apple ultra high definition televisions at $1,600 per unit, especially
        when considering both its track record of introducing best in class products
        and its market share in smartphones and tablets.4 At a gross margin of 37.7%,
        which would be consistent with that of the overall company, such a debut would
        add $40 billion of revenues and $15 billion to operating income annually.5\\r\\nThe
        possibility of a television represents only one opportunity for the company
        that stems from new products in new categories. While we won\u2019t go through
        all of them here, we see several major opportunities in hardware alone. With
        advancements in miniaturization and continued improvements in Siri, it seems
        obvious to us that Apple has a compelling opportunity in the exciting area
        of wearable devices, supported by rumors that Apple is developing a smartwatch
        (as Tim Cook himself said the wrist is \u201Can area of great interest for
        Apple\u201D). While many consider Apple a hardware company, to pigeonhole
        it as such is no longer appropriate in our opinion. Apple has built an ecosystem
        of hardware, software, and services that we believe collectively represents
        the most successful consumer product platform in the entire history of consumer-facing
        technologies. And as Apple\u2019s customer base continues to enjoy the use
        of this ecosystem, storing media in the cloud and moving it from one Apple
        device to another as doing so becomes increasingly convenient with innovations
        such as Airplay (as just one simple example of this ecosystem\u2019s current
        functionality), we believe that customer base grows increasingly loyal and
        excited for the next Apple product release, making it an asset in and of itself
        that grows and becomes increasingly valuable. Indeed, we believe any new software
        service that offers new functionality to this customer base becomes a large
        opportunity for Apple to introduce as a revolutionary and disruptive bolt-on
        to the ecosystem. As just one of many possible examples of this phenomenon,
        Apple could introduce a next generation payments solution. In terms of whether
        the marketplace is well addressed by mobile payments solutions, Tim Cook has
        said \u201CI think it is in its infancy\u2026 I think it is just getting started
        and just of out of the starting block.\u201D With the fingerprint sensor,
        iBeacon, 575+ million credit card numbers stored in iTunes, and Apple\u2019s
        homogeneous iOS installed base with 79% of devices using iOS 7, we believe
        a revolutionary payments solution is now a very real opportunity that the
        company could choose to pursue. With respect to all of Apple\u2019s new and
        existing opportunities for growth, they will only prove to be successful with
        strong execution from the company\u2019s management, in whom we hold great
        confidence. Naysayers say Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs, and they\u2019re absolutely
        right. He is Tim Cook and we believe he is doing an excellent job, and Jonathan
        Ive, Senior VP of Design, is Jonathan Ive and we believe he\u2019s doing an
        excellent job, etcetera.\\r\\nIn this letter, we have above summarized why
        we believe Apple is undervalued in order to express how ridiculous it seems
        to us for Apple to horde so much cash rather than repurchase stock (and thereby
        use that cash to make a larger investment in itself for the benefit of all
        of the company\u2019s shareholders). In its statement in opposition to our
        proposal, the company claims that \u201Cthe Board and management team have
        demonstrated a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders\u201D
        and we believe that is true, but we also believe that commitment is not strong
        enough given the unique degree to which the company is both undervalued and
        overcapitalized. Furthermore, it is important to note that a share repurchase
        is not simply an act of \u201Creturning capital to shareholders\u201D since
        it is also the company effectively making an investment in itself. To us,
        as long term investors, this is an important difference: a dividend is a pure
        return of capital while a share repurchase is the company making an investment
        in itself by buying shares in the market at the current price, which we believe
        to be undervalued, from shareholders willing to sell at that price for the
        benefit of shareholders who choose to remain investors for the longer term.
        And we are long term investors. It should be noted that no one on the Board
        seems to be an expert in the world of investment management. However, based
        on our record, we believe few will argue that we are experts in this area,
        and we have no doubts that the Board is doing a great disservice to its shareholders
        by not immediately increasing the size of the share repurchase program in
        order to more effectively take advantage of what we believe to be the company\u2019s
        low market valuation.\\r\\nWe have expressed above what we believe to be the
        company\u2019s primary reason for not supporting our proposal. Conversely,
        it is our belief that Apple\u2019s current excess liquidity is without historical
        precedent and beyond reasonable comparison to its peers or otherwise, and
        such dramatic overcapitalization affords the company enough excess liquidity
        to repurchase the amount of shares we proposed. Apple\u2019s existing capital
        return program has just $37 billion remaining, and the company has until the
        end of 2015 to complete it. Without any changes to the program, the largest
        pile of corporate cash in the world is likely to grow even larger, and if
        the share price rises, this Board will have missed a great opportunity to
        use more of that hoarded cash to repurchase shares at an attractive value.
        While it is important for the Board to focus on the return of capital on a
        sustained basis, it is also important for the Board to evaluate whether or
        not its share price is undervalued and to take advantage of it with share
        repurchases, especially when the balance sheet exhibits dramatic excess liquidity,
        as we believe Apple\u2019s does today.\\r\\nThe Board may argue that with
        so much opportunity, it would be prudent to maintain its excess liquidity
        to increase R or make acquisitions, especially when considering the financial
        strength of its competitors. We completely agree that the company must innovate
        and should be flexible to make prudent strategic acquisitions, yet even after
        taking such factors into account, we believe that tremendous excess liquidity
        remains. With respect to possible M (to which the company does not refer in
        its statement), for the opportunities highlighted above (a TV, a watch, a
        payment service), we find it extremely difficult to identify any possible
        strategic acquisitions of scale that make sense. Furthermore, such action
        would seem to conflict with Apple\u2019s culture historically. A remarkable
        fact is that since the Board reacquired Steve Jobs through the NeXT acquisition
        for $427 million in 1997, the next largest acquisition Apple made was $2.6
        billion for Nortel\u2019s patent portfolio. Amazingly, over these 17 years,
        Apple made just $7.8 billion worth of acquisitions in total during this timeframe.
        Apple clearly has a long history and culture of developing its innovation
        internally, which leads us to believe that the company will not seek out large
        acquisitions to pursue any of the opportunities about which we have speculated.
        In terms of paying for the necessary innovation internally, Apple is expected
        to generate $40 billion of earnings next year, which already takes into account
        an increasing R expense. In order to address the argument that Apple should
        reserve excess liquidity to more effectively compete with some of its deep-pocketed
        competitors, there is no doubt that some of them also have significant earnings
        and net cash on their balance sheets (whether or not that is appropriate).
        But Apple has much more. When compared to its next largest competitor, Microsoft,
        for example, Apple has $68 billion more net cash and is expected to generate
        $18 billion more in earnings during 2014.\\r\\nThe Board may argue that much
        of its cash and earnings are international and therefore subject to a repatriation
        tax if returned to the United States to repurchase shares. While this is true,
        we question why the company would not simply borrow the money in the Unites
        States to the extent it deems its domestic cash of $36 billion and domestic
        earnings are insufficient. Given that the company has $130 billion of net
        cash and $40 billion of expected annual earnings, and the fact that it is
        hard to find a better time in history to borrow money, a $50 billion share
        repurchase over the course of fiscal year 2014 seems more than reasonable
        to us. Today, Apple\u2019s outstanding ten year bonds yield 3.63%, and its
        five year bonds yield 2%. Apple could either continue to carry this debt,
        repay it from its domestic earnings over time, or repatriate cash from abroad
        upon the passage of corporate tax reform.\\r\\nThe company has stated that
        it is \u201Cupdating perspectives on its capital return program for 2014 and
        beyond\u201D and \u201Ccollecting input from a very broad base of shareholders.\u201D
        We believe, if our proposal receives majority shareholder support, that the
        Board should respect it and increase the repurchase program as requested.
        We believe this action will greatly enhance value for all long term shareholders
        who believe, as we do, in the great potential of this company. If the Board
        takes this action, we will applaud them for taking advantage of one of the
        greatest examples of a \u201Cno brainer\u201D we have seen in five decades
        of successful investing.\\r\\nSincerely yours,\\r\\nCarl C. Icahn\",\n  \"language\":
